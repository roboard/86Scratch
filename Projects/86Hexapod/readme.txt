86Hexapod is a open-source and 3D-printed hexapod robot designed to show the robotics application of 86Duino. This robot employs an 86Duino ZERO or ONE as its controller and 12 TowerPro SG90 servos as its actuators (12-DOF), thus being very low-cost.

In this 86Scratch project, you can easily connect Scratch to 86Hexapod for controlling its motions without writing one line of additional code.
