#### [86Scratch](https://github.com/roboard/86Scratch) ####
86Scratch is a cross-platform application program that can connect your Scratch 2.0 creations to an 86Duino without need to write any additional code. 
It is designed to be very easy to use and to be customized, so that the user can change every UI element and text without modifying any line of the source code; 
moreover, adding/deleting new Scratch hardware extensions and demos can directly be done in 86Scratch's menu. 

86Scratch is developed based on [S2A](http://mryslab.blogspot.tw/) of Alan Yorinks, and supports Windows 7/8/10, Linux, and Mac OS X.

#### [86Duino](https://github.com/roboard/86Duino) ####

integrates PCIE bus, DDR3 DRAM, ROM controller, xISA, I2C, SPI, Motor/Motion Controller, IPC, Fast Ethernet, FIFO UART, USB2.0 and SD/SATA controller within a single package.
