86Humanoid Rider is a fantastic 3D-printed small biped robot that employs a special tiny 86Duino board (86Duino Ai) as its controller. This robot has 21 joints, thus can performing various non-trivial actions and walking smoothly. It is currently made and presented to DMP's VIP as a gift.

In this 86Scratch project, one can easily connect Scratch to 86Humanoid Rider for controlling its motions without writing one line of additional code.
